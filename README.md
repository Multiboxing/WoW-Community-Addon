# weMultibox - "WMB"
weMultibox, the Community Multiboxing Addon for World of Warcraft

The basic principles of weMultibox are simple:
* weMultibox should be **by and for the multiboxing community**. No one is solely responsible for weMultibox.
* weMultibox should be **modular**, using WoW's existing Addon management system to select major groups of features (modules).

# Proposed Modules
* weMultibox Core: Core features required for being a good modular Addon for Multiboxers
* weMultibox Dialogs: Tools for confirmation boxes, etc
* weMultibox Inventory: Tools for inventory management (?)
* weMultibox ISBoxer: Anything specific to ISBoxer integration (such as syncing with the ISBoxer team) goes here
* weMultibox Follow: Tools for auto-follow including strobing and follow after combat
* weMultibox Loot: Tools for looting
* weMultibox Quest: Tools for accepting, tracking and completing quests
* weMultibox Taxi: Tools for flight paths
* weMultibox Trade: Tools to help unload bags onto your slaves?
* weMultibox Vendor: Tools for automatically selling items to vendors, etc
